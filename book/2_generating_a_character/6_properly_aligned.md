## Chapter 6 - Properly aligned

![](figures/alignment.png)

Now for the final trait.  Alignment determines how the actions you take in game will affect you. If you do things that contrast your alignment your god will be angry with you and the game will become more difficult.

First let's follow suit and create a `data/alignments.yaml` file with the following:

```yaml
---
- name: lawful
  hotkey: l
- name: neutral
  hotkey: n
- name: chaotic
  hotkey: c
```

The alignments you are allowed to choose from depend on your race and role. If your role is anything other than human, your alignment is predetermined, whereas humans can choose any alignment available to the role. So for each race we need to add an `alignments` key to `data/races.yaml` with the following values:

* Human: lnc
* Dwarf: l
* Gnome: n
* Orc: c
* Elf: c

You'll need to do the same thing in `data/roles.yaml`:

* Archeologist: ln
* Barbarian: nc
* Caveman ln
* Healer: n
* Knight: l
* Monk: lnc
* Priest: lnc
* Rogue: c
* Ranger: nc
* Samurai: l
* Tourist: n
* Valkyrie: ln
* Wizard: nc

To finish off editing our data let's add the following to the end of `data/messages.yaml`:

```yaml
alignment:
  choosing: Choosing Alignment
  instructions: Pick the alignment of your %gender %race %role
```

Now since our available alignments depend on both our role and our race we'll need to create the following `alignment.rb`:

```ruby
class Alignment
  def self.for_options(options)
    role = options[:role]
    race = options[:race]
    possible = role.alignments.chars & race.alignments.chars

    all.select { |alignment| possible.include? alignment.hotkey }
  end

  def self.all
    DataLoader.load_file("alignments").map do |data|
      new(data)
    end
  end

  attr_reader :name, :hotkey

  def initialize(data)
    data.each do |key, value|
      instance_variable_set("@#{key}", value)
    end
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end
end
```

Finally you'll want to add `Alignment` to the end of `TRAITS` in `game.rb`, add the appropriate require before requiring `game` in `main.rb`, and add `:alignments` as an `attr_reader` to `Role` and `Race`.

Running the program now you should see it output all of chosen traits.
