## Chapter i - Why write this book?

The reason I decided to write this book is because game development was one of the things that first attracted me to developing software. I started programming in highschool with QBasic. QBasic made it pretty easy to enter into a graphics mode and start drawing on the screen. It wasn't long before I had written a very primitive RPG. Nowadays, it's much harder to get started due to the complexities of graphical hardware and complex operating system interactions. Roguelikes allow us to simplfy things once again.

There is a certain purity in an ASCII based game - there is very little overhead and very little math required to get started. Imagination also plays a large role. Most games these days have taken imagination out of the equation. I know what everything looks like because the game's artists have fleshed it all out. However, games like NetHack allow me to imagine what's going on and to in some ways weave my own story.

Because I've found a lot of enjoyment in playing games like NetHack, I've developed a natural curiosity for the internal workings. How would one go about creating the same kind of game? I've spent considerable time diving in and out of the C code to answer that question. I hope this book will answer that question for you as well.
