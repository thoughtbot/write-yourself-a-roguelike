## Chapter ii - What is NetHack?

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/nethack.png}

NetHack is an ASCII based roguelike originally released in 1987, but it is currently still being further developed. It is a sort of evolution of Rogue. You're still descending down through levels and levels of dungeons to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, but your goal now is to escape the dungeon, ascend through the elemental planes until you get to the astral plane in which you offer the amulet to your assigned god and are granted demigodhood (never thought I'd type that word).

There are also a number of other aspects that make NetHack more interesting. There is considerable depth added on top of the original Rogue-formula. Instead of being a generic adventurer you can be a samurai, valkyrie, tourist, or other role each with their own specific quest. You have a race and alignment which will affect how monsters interact with you and even what you can do in the game (at the cost of angering your god). There are multiple paths in the dungeon and you can return to earlier levels (usually necessary to win).

As we build our roguelike, we will continously reference NetHack for both implementation and inspiration. We can do this because NetHack is open source, and while the code-base is almost 30 years old, I've gone ahead and spent countless hours using lldb to figure out what's going on for you.
